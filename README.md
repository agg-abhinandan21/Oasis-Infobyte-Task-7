💳 Task-7: Fraud Detection – Oasis Infobyte Internship 🔍

As part of my Oasis Infobyte Data Science & Machine Learning Internship, I completed Task-7, focusing on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning techniques.

📌 Project Overview:

The objective was to analyze a large credit card transactions dataset and build a predictive model capable of identifying fraudulent activities in real time. Fraud detection is a highly imbalanced classification problem, making it a challenging and impactful task in the field of data science.

🛠 Steps Involved:

🔹 Data Exploration & Cleaning – Handled missing values, explored data imbalance, and understood transaction patterns.
🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized trends using histograms, heatmaps, and class distribution charts.
🔹 Data Balancing – Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to handle class imbalance.
🔹 Model Building – Trained models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for fraud detection.
🔹 Model Evaluation – Used Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC to ensure model effectiveness (since accuracy alone is not reliable for imbalanced data).
🔹 Insights – Developed a system that can identify fraudulent transactions with high recall, minimizing financial losses.

💡 Outcome:

The final model demonstrated strong detection capabilities and can serve as a foundation for real-world fraud detection systems in the banking and fintech industries.

Tech Stack: Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Scikit-learn | XGBoost | SMOTE
